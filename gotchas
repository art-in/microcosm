1. React does not (want to?) support namespaced attributes...
   And 'xlink:href' is necessary for UA to ref path from textPath.
   In 0.14 we will use 'xlinkHref' and for now go with 'dangerouslySetInnerHTML'.

2. Chrome does not redraw textPath on path change
   when <text> and <defs> are in different <g>-groups ...
   Force redraw by setting random id attr.
